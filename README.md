# NaivesBayesClassifier-To-Classify-IrisFlower
Naives bayes classifier to classifier to classify Iris Flower. This is the most prominent Machine Learning dataset available online. There three Iris Flowers namely Iris Setosa, Iris Versicolor and Iris Virginica . The Iris Dataset contains four features (length and width of sepals and petals) of 50 samples of three species of Iris (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). These measures were used to create a linear discriminant model to classify the species. The dataset is often used in data mining, classification and clustering examples and to test algorithms. Naives Bayes worked wonderfully and achieved an accuracy of 100%.
